# Agroforest Data Analysis and Insights
**Project Overview**

This repository presents an interactive and real-time monitoring dashboard for the Agroforestry Program. The dashboard visualizes key metrics such as tree plantation progress over time, distribution of tree species, geographic coverage by districts, and training/contract status of farmers. It serves as a tool for decision-makers, field officers, and stakeholders to track program implementation and ensure timely interventions.

**Problem Statement**

As Agroforestry data is collected from the field, it becomes challenging to manually monitor large volumes of entries, identify gaps, and verify the rollout of activities. Stakeholders need an intuitive interface that provides instant visibility into plantation progress, resource distribution, and farmer engagement across regions. A centralized dashboard can fill this gap by turning raw data into actionable insights.

**Key Objective**

Convert field-collected data into real-time insights.

Monitor progress of plantations, training, and resource distribution.

Identify inconsistencies and underperforming regions visually.

Enable district-wise and tree-type-wise tracking and analysis.

Plantation Progress Over Time: Time series showing cumulative plantation area across months.

Tree Type Distribution: Pie chart of trees planted by species.

District-wise UID Count: Color-coded district participation using UID breakdown.

Training & Contract Status: Bar chart showing farmers who completed training and contracts.

Comprehensive Report: A summary of key findings, insights, and recommendations.

Visualizations: Charts and graphs that illustrate critical aspects of the data.

**Expected Outcome**

The project delivers a professional dashboard that:

Visualizes tree plantation trends and type distribution.

Tracks training and contract activity status.

Breaks down district-level farmer participation.

Assists in identifying areas requiring corrective actions.
